### AI Summary
The key changes in this document involve specific licensing requirements for different types of controlled drug products: therapeutic products, active ingredients/laboratory reagents/veterinary products, and diagnostic test kits now have distinct rules. Notably, diagnostic test kits now allow multiple consignments under a single licence valid for one year, while other products remain restricted to single consignments with six-month validity. Additionally, all applications now require supplementary licences specific to the product type (therapeutic product dealer's licence, active ingredient importer's licence, medical device licences, or Form A Poisons Licence) alongside the controlled drug licence.
