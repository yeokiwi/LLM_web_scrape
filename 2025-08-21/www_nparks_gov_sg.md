Key changes include mandatory establishment of Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) for oversight, specific training requirements for researchers and personnel, and the implementation of occupational health and safety programs, all enforced through licensing and inspections by the Animal & Veterinary Service (AVS).
