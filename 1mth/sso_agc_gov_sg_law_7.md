### AI Summary
The 2025 amendment to the Auxiliary Police Forces Regulations introduces significant changes to regulation 21 regarding auxiliary police officers' outside employment, requiring either employer approval (with specific conflict-of-interest safeguards) or Commissioner permission, while adding a new Schedule that explicitly lists activities deemed to create conflicts of interest (including debt collection, private investigation, security services, and certain moneylending roles). It also updates regulation 33A to include oversight of such outside engagements and makes minor technical corrections to replace "Part IX" with "Part 9" in two provisions.
