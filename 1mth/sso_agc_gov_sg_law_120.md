### AI Summary
The 2025 amendment introduces a new definition for "addition and alteration works" and modifies the approval process for parking provisions. Developers must now submit proposals and plans to the Authority (rather than just lodging them) for developments involving indoor parking, residential/commercial use, and excluding mere addition/alteration works, with specific application timing and content requirements. Consequential changes update cross-references and terminology to align with the renumbered and revised rule structure.
