### AI Summary
The 2025 amendments to the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea (Air) Regulations introduce several key changes, including a new definition for "gas fuel" and updated requirements for non-identical replacement engines that may now meet Tier II standards instead of Tier III under specific conditions. They also exempt low-flashpoint and gas fuels from certain fuel oil service system sampling requirements, revise bunker delivery note specifications to include these fuels, and expand data sharing provisions by allowing the IMO Secretary-General to share data with research entities and grant public access to company fuel consumption reports upon request. Additionally, Appendix IX is replaced with a more detailed fuel oil consumption reporting template.
