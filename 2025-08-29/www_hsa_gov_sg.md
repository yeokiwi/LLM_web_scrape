### AI Summary
The key changes in this document involve the introduction of specific requirements for diagnostic test kits containing controlled drugs, which now allow a single licence to cover multiple consignments and have a one-year validity period, unlike other product categories that require separate licences per product and are valid for only six months. Additionally, all licence applications now require supplementary licences or approvals depending on the product type (e.g., therapeutic product dealer’s licence, medical device importer’s licence, or Form A Poisons Licence), and post-approval audits are emphasized for ongoing compliance.
