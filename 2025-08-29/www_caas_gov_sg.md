The document reflects updates to Singapore's Air Navigation Act, primarily through the introduction of new Protected Areas Orders in 2024 that expand aviation security regulations to cover specific military facilities (Army, Navy, Air Force), training areas, offshore installations, critical infrastructure (water supply, telecommunications, hospitals), and non-military locations, while maintaining previous regulations from 2017-2023 covering dangerous goods, carbon emissions, and operational rules.
