### AI Summary
The key changes in the controlled drugs licensing requirements include the introduction of distinct validity periods and application scopes for different product categories: diagnostic test kits now allow multiple consignments under a single annual licence, while therapeutic products, active ingredients, laboratory reagents, and veterinary products remain limited to single-consignment licences valid for six months. Additionally, all licences are now product-specific, requiring separate applications for each product, and diagnostic test kits have specific documentation requirements including detailed drug concentration and volume disclosures.
