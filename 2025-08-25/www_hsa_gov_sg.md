### AI Summary
The key changes in this document involve the introduction of distinct licensing requirements for diagnostic test kits containing controlled drugs, which now allow multiple consignments under a single one-year licence (unlike the single-consignment, six-month licences for therapeutic products, active ingredients, reagents, and veterinary products) and require either a medical device importerâ€™s licence/approval or a Form A Poisons Licence for application. Additionally, all licences for import (CDIL) and export (CDEL) remain non-renewable, requiring new applications upon expiry, while wholesale licences (CDWL) are renewable annually.
