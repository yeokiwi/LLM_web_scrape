This document outlines updates to Singapore's Air Navigation Act, primarily through the introduction of new 2024 regulations that expand the scope of protected areas under aviation security. These include specific orders for military facilities (Army Division, Headquarters, Navy, Air Force, and various training facilities), critical infrastructure (water supply, telecommunications, hospitals), and non-military locations, enhancing restrictions on air operations around these sites to bolster national security.
