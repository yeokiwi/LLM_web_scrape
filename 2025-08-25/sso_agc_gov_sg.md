### AI Summary
The 2025 revised edition of the Human Biomedical Research (Requirements for Appropriate Consent — Exemption) Regulations 2019 introduces several key changes to consent requirements: it exempts the need for a witness to consent for non-invasive, non-interventional, or minimal-risk interventional research, as well as for tissue donors in therapeutic or diagnostic contexts or minimal-risk procedures, provided the subject can read and sign the form. It also clarifies exemptions for consent given before specific dates (e.g., November 2017 for research subjects, November 2019 for tissue donors) and for the use of biological material or health information obtained before November 2018 with prior documented consent. Additionally, it removes the requirement for parental consent for blood donated by minors aged 18 or older in national donation programs, provided the minor has sufficient understanding and gives informed consent.
