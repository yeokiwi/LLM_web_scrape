### AI Summary
The key changes in this document pertain to the specific requirements for diagnostic test kits containing controlled drugs, which now allow for multiple consignments under a single licence valid for one year, unlike other controlled drug categories that require separate one-time licences per product valid for six months. Additionally, diagnostic test kits now require a medical device importer’s or wholesaler’s licence (or Form A Poisons Licence) depending on the activity, aligning them with medical device regulations rather than therapeutic product or active ingredient licensing frameworks.
