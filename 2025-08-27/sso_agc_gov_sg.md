The 2025 revised edition of the Human Biomedical Research (Requirements for Appropriate Consent — Exemption) Regulations 2019 introduces several key changes, primarily expanding exemptions from the witness requirement for consent in non-invasive, non-interventional, or minimal-risk research, and clarifying that consent obtained before specific dates (1 November 2017 for research subjects and 1 November 2019 for tissue donors) is exempt from witness requirements. It also adds exemptions for using pre-existing biological material or health information obtained before 1 November 2018 with prior consent, and allows minors aged 18 or older to consent independently for blood donation in research under certain conditions, removing the need for parental or guardian consent.
